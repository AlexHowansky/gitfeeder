INSTALL
-------

1. If you don't already have ZendFramework, grab it and drop it somewhere
   accessible to the web server user. The minimal packge is sufficient.
   Keep this out of the document root if possible.

   % cd /path/to/mysite
   % wget http://framework.zend.com/releases/ZendFramework-1.10.5/ZendFramework-1.10.5-minimal.tar.gz
   % tar xzf ZendFramework-1.10.5-minimal.tar.gz
   % rm ZendFramework-1.10.5-minimal.tar.gz

2, Clone the gitfeeder code to the document root for your site:

   % cd /path/to/mysite/public
   % git clone git://github.com/AlexHowansky/gitfeeder.git

3. Edit the config.php file and set your local preferences.

   % cd gitfeeder
   % vi config.php

4. If you want short URIs and you're using Apache, make sure mod_rewrite is
   loaded and available in your Apache config, and that your document root
   directory is configured to allow .htaccess files.

5. That's it, now just point your feed reader at the proper URI. If you've
   installed to http://mysite.com/gitfeeder, then your URI for repository
   "repo" and branch "branch" will be:

   http://mysite.com/gitfeeder/index.php?r=repo&b=branch

   Alternatively, if you've got short URIs enabled, you can just use:

   http://mysite.com/gitfeeder/repo/branch
